# Color-Guess
Guess the random color from the list

## Working
The user has got three chances in total and has to guess a color from the list provided, which would be matched against the random color from the same list. 
The input color and the random color will be displayed on a turtle screen, which is generally used for graphics. The colors will be filled within circles, which will be displayed
one after the other. Turtle module is used for implementing it, and the purpose was to get to know more about the same 
(not mandatory to use this module, it also works without it).

## Output
It appears on both idle as well as on the turtle screen
